You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii! To help with your trip planning, you need to do some climate analysis on the area. The following outlines what you need to do.

## Step 1 - Climate Analysis and Exploration

Using Python and SQLAlchemy to do basic climate analysis and data exploration of climate database. All of the analysis has been completed using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

### Precipitation Analysis
### Station Analysis


## Step 2 - Climate App 
Please refer app.py

### Routes
/api/v1.0/precipitation
/api/v1.0/stations
/api/v1.0/tobs
/api/v1.0/start_date
/api/v1.0/start_date/end_date
        
## Bonus:

### Temperature Analysis I
Please refer pandas_bonus.ipynb

Across all the stations, the mean temperatures in June and December temperature in years 2010-2017 differ by 3.9 degrees Celsius. An unpaired t-test was conducted, and with an extremely low p-value, the difference is deemed statistically significant.
